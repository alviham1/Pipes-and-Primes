# Pipes-and-Primes
â€¢	Sieve of Eratosthenes: Wrote excellent code that can be used in standard public key cryptography, which is based on the mathematical difficulty of finding two prime factors of a very large number. The program can return the two prime factors of huge numbers extremely fast if they exist otherwise It notifies the user if the number provided is prime itself or if its not the product of exactly two primes. Skills/concepts used: Processes and pipes, Systems programming in C.
